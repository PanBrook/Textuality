# Textuality

Planning for roadmaps and versions -

Version 0.1
Enjoy the very basics of what this game will have to offer ~
- Character stats (Strength/Dexterity/Intelligence/Wisdom/Charisma/Luck)
- System Screen forever present on the bottom left of the screen (for now will only hold the quest system screen and companion system)
- the foundations of a large and detailed resource management. only holds stone and wood but we all start somewhere right. 

Which means buttons GALORE ~
- button to go to the forest and back ^
- button to open player screen
- button to open quest screen
- button to open companion screen
- button to collect stones/wood ^
- button to pass the day ^

Keeping this version as text less as possible which is like "OMG you mad woman what do you mean your text heavy game started off with no text?" yeah all that text requires me to type it up and i need to focues that on having something to attach that text to. 

problems? ~
the resource management screen which is the foundation of everything is broken. i need it to show up on both the main base screen and the forest screen but right now it only shows up on the forest screen. need to fix that.
I decided to forgo the quest and companion system at this version as it makes perfectly no sense because there's no story yet. but have no fear, ill fix the resource bug and push to version 0.2!
